# NYT-Spelling-Bee
Replica of NYT Spelling Bee game created in Java. Parsed player input to track guesses and validated input. 
Provided feedback to players on whether pangram was guessed, whether the core letter was used, whether guess had enough letters,
whether guess is a valid word in the dictionary. Kept track of valid guesses, accumulated points and created game conditions.
